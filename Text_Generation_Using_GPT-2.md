# NLP Based Project :

To Understanding the Project : **Text Generation using GPT-2!** 

*The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset so it can generate text that mimics the style, tone, and structure of your dataset.* Here's what this involves:

**1.What is GPT-2?**
* A generative pre-trained transformer model developed by OpenAI.
* Designed to predict the next word in a sequence, making it powerful for tasks like text generation.

**2.Why Fine-Tune?**
* Pre-trained GPT-2 has been trained on general data but might not align with your specific use case (e.g., legal, poetic, or technical writing). Fine-tuning adapts it to your dataset.

**3.What Will the Model Do?**
* After fine-tuning, the model can take a text prompt and generate new content in the style of your dataset.
  Example:
    i]   Dataset style: Old English literature
    ii]  Prompt: "Upon the hills, there arose..."
    iii] Output: "...a gentle mist, veiling the valley in a cloak of ethereal splendor."

**4.Tools Weâ€™ll Use:**
* Hugging Face's Transformers library: Simplifies working with GPT-2 and other models.
* Google Colab: A free, GPU-enabled environment for faster processing.
* Your Custom Dataset: Text data reflecting the style you want the model to learn.
